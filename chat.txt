This is our submission for milestone 1 of the Software Engineering project in uni. MIlestone 1.2 requires us to use GenAI to enhance and improve our user stories that are in the excel file provided.
Your task is to improve the user stories/ replace stories as much as you can. But you are limited to only 50 User Stories.

The case description is as follows:
(
GUC students must complete a 3-month internship before they are eligible for graduation.
Many students manage to find internships on their own, while others may refer to the
SCAD office for help. Consequently, the process of finding and completing an internship
through the SCAD office includes the following:
• Companies inform SCAD of internship opportunities, where internships offered can
have a duration that starts with one month and extends until 6 months. Internships
can be paid or unpaid.
• Students need to navigate announcements made by companies recruiting interns
until they find a suitable opportunity and apply for it.
• Companies during the filtration process typically check CVs and conduct interviews
before they offer internships to candidate students.
• If accepted, students proceed with their intern jobs until they conclude the tasks
required.
• After the internship is successfully done, there are two types of evaluations that
take place:
– Companies evaluate the intern across several metrics and dimensions, and the
intern evaluates the company in a free form feedback text.
– Students can recommend the company to other interns, and they are required
to provide input on the faculty courses that helped them the most during the
internship.
• The intern is then required to create a report designed by SCAD. The report has
sections that provide an overview of the company’s business and market stand, the
tasks performed by the intern, and the feedback about the company’s work environment and the helpful courses, together with the student’s recommendation

You need to construct a web application (you may assume that it is connected to the
university’s database) to help students, Faculty academics, companies and the
SCAD office take care of the tasks mentioned in Section 2 above, where the entire
process is digitized.
